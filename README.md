## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

- Layouts.
- Media Queries.
- Flexbox.
- Using the inspector to help with positioning.
- Using Figma to help with fonts and colors.

### Continued development

I need to learn more about responsiveness using media queries as well as using flexbox and grid. Also, keep things simple and learn more about Semantic HTML.
